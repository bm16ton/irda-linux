Template: irda-utils/selectdevice
Type: select
_Choices: serial, native
Default: serial
_Description: IrDA device type:
 If you want to use a serial dongle, a FIR (Fast IrDA) serial emulation port or
 something similar choose "serial". Otherwise choose "native" for a native
 chip driver. Select "serial" if unsure, because nearly all FIR devices can
 run in slow SIR (Serial IrDA) mode. You might cross-check with the package
 "setserial" for the serial setup of your system.

Template: irda-utils/ttydev
Type: string
Default: /dev/ttyS1
_Description: Serial device file for IrDA:

Template: irda-utils/dongle
Type: select
_Choices: none, act200l, actisys, actisys+, airport, ep7211, esi, girbil, litelink, ma600, mcp2120, old_belkin, tekram
Default: none
_Description: Dongle type:
 If you use a FIR serial emulation port, choose "none". Note that it is possible that your actual kernel supports more/less/other dongle types. In that case you
 have to edit /etc/default/irda-utils by hand.

Template: irda-utils/firdev
Type: select
Choices: ali-ircc, au1k_ir, irda-usb, nsc-ircc, sa1100_ir, smc-ircc, smsc-ircc2, stir4200, toshoboe, via-ircc, vlsi_ir, w83977af_ir
_Description: FIR chip type:
 Note that you must have a properly built kernel module if you want to use
 a native chip. The modules offered here can be different to the ones that
 are available for your actual kernel. In that case you have to edit
 /etc/modutils/irda-utils (2.4) or /etc/modprobe.d/irda-utils (2.6) by hand.

Template: irda-utils/firopt
Type: string
_Description: Module options for the FIR chip:
 Some kernel modules require options to work. You can retrieve the possible
 options for your module with the command "modinfo <modulename>".

Template: irda-utils/setserial
Type: string
_Description: Port for setserial to quiet:
 Set the name of the serial port / device which should be quieted by setserial.
 Only few machines need that when in FIR-mode, so most likely, it should be
 left blank. See README.Debian for more information.

Template: irda-utils/discovery
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Discovery behavior?
 Confirm if you want to use discovery mode. When in discovery mode, the
 device in your machine looks for other devices on a regular basis.

Template: irda-utils/enable
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Enable IrDA on system startup?
 Confirm if you want IrDA to be enabled when your system is booting. This is
 necessary for devices that need "irattach" to be run. Most devices need it,
 except for some rare FIR devices.

Template: irda-utils/automatic
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Attempt to probe for IrDA on system bootup?
 Confirm if you want to attempt to autoconfigure IrDA on system startup. If 
 a device is found, irattach will automatically be started up.

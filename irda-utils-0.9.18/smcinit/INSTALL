 Installing smcinit
 ==================

 
 Prerequisites
 -------------
 
 To successfully compile and install SMCINIT package you
 need to:
 
 * have a Linux 2.4.x based system. Prefferably Linux 2.4.18
 kernel or better. 
 
 * have GCC compiler and glibc devel package installed
 
 * have pciutils and pciutils-devel packages installed
 
 
 Compile & install
 -----------------
 
 If you got the dist tarball, such as smcinit-0.5.tar.gz, untar it:

   tar xvfj smcinit-0.5.tar.gz
   cd smcinit-0.5

 then:

   ./configure
   make
   make install (as root user)
   

 If you brave just checked out from the irda CVS, one more step is needed first:

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   make install (as root user)

   
 Notes
 -----
 
 I tested the package on SuSE 8.1 and RedHat 9.0. It should work for any
 recent Linux distribution.
 
  Here are relevant packages to compile on SuSE 8.1:
    pciutils-devel-2.1.10-33
    pciutils-2.1.10-33
    libgcc-3.2-39
    gcc-3.2-39
    glibc-2.2.5-153
    glibc-locale-2.2.5-154
    glibc-devel-2.2.5-154

  Here are relevant packages to compile on RedHat 9.0:
    pciutils-2.1.10-7
    pciutils-devel-2.1.10-7
    gcc-3.2.2-5
    libgcc-3.2.2-5
    gcc-c++-3.2.2-5
    glibc-devel-2.3.2-11.9
    glibc-common-2.3.2-11.9
    glibc-2.3.2-11.9
    glibc-kernheaders-2.4-8.10

  Send me your story and packages when you compile these package on a system
  other than above ones. Thank you very much!

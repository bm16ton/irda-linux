 SMCINIT
 =======


 Introduction
 ------------

 This package is good for you if you own a Linux machine that have SMC-IRCC based
 IrDA subsystem and the BIOS doesn't initialize it. Otherwise you don't
 need it at all.

 If you reading here, then you may be the unhappy owner of Toshiba Satellite
 1800, Toshiba Satellite 5100 or Toshiba Tecra 9100 laptop. Well, there's
 a chance that a bunch of other Toshiba laptops may share the same buggy BIOS
 and IrDA problems.


 Making it work
 --------------

 Daniele Peri, Rob Miller and Paul Hampson mananged to build little utilities
 that initialize the LPC47N227 SuperIO allowing smc-ircc IrDA kernel driver
 to detect and use the SMSC chip.

 Note that for starting with Linux kernels from 2.6.x series this initializing
 will be integrated to the new smc-ircc kernel driver.


 Documentation
 -------------

 Read the man pages.

 man smcminit           (intro to smcinit utilities)

 man tosh1800-smcinit   (built from Daniele Peri documentation and with my own additions)

 Read the very good documetation made by utilities authors. Note that man pages have
 been built from these docs.

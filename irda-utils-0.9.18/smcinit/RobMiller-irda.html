    <h1>IRDA on the Toshiba 5100</h1>

Skip to <a href="#smc-bugfix">here</a> for info on the bugfix so you can use 
smc-ircc with SWSUSP.
<p>
The 5100 has an Intel 82801CAM PCI bridge which includes an LPC interface; 
on this interface is an SMSC LPC47N227 Super I/O chip.  The 47N227 has various
interfaces (FDC, 2xRS232, IR, parallel), but it seems that only the IR is 
connected out to a physical port on the case.  There are no standard serial 
(RS232) ports on the 5100.  Unfortunately the BIOS does not set up either 
the LPC interface or the SMC IR in a way that the Linux smc-ircc driver 
expects.  

<P>

This is the same story as on the <A href="http://www.csai.unipa.it/peri/toshsat1800-irdasetup/"><strong>Satellite 1800</strong></A> but a different
PCI bridge interface.  The work here is based directly on <A href="http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/18052/2001/10/50/8836003/"><strong>Paul Hampson's post</strong></A> (updated link!) to Linux-IrDA, although I made a small change to get it 
working.
<P>

The program <A href="./tosh5100-smcinit.c"><strong>tosh5100-smcinit.c</strong></A> performs 
both of these functions, (1) set up 
the 82801 LPC interface to pass the standard COM1 port (and hopefully the SMC FIR 
on DMA 3 as well - but see below), and (2) set up the 47N227 to enable SIR on its UART2, assign
it to 0x3f8 irq 3, and assign the FIR interface to 0x130.  

<P>
You should end up with something like 
<PRE>
 kernel: SMC IrDA Controller found
 kernel:  IrCC version 2.0, firport 0x130, sirport 0x2f8 dma=3, irq=3
 kernel: irport_open_R0016f49f()
</PRE>
<P>
in your logs after "modprobe smc-ircc".  I have seen it fail the first time when loaded my modprobe due to 
"irport_open_R0016f49f(), can't get iobase of 0x3f8", just modprobe again.  I've not seen
this when loading by from /etc/modules.   
<P>
Please note:  (1) I have only been able to test the SIR portion
of this, as my motivator was to enable connecting a Palm III equivalent, and 
(2) development of the code linked here stopped pretty quickly once it started
working, so there are multiple silly ideas, tries, etc. commented out.

<P>
The set-up is as follows:
<PRE>
  1. you need the lib files from pci-utils (pciutils-dev on debian).

  2. the command to build it is 

gcc -g -O2 -o tosh5100-smcinit tosh5100-smcinit.c -lpci -L/usr/lib -I/usr/include/pci

   assuming your pci-utils lib is where mine is.  put the binary in /usr/local/sbin.

  3. enable the standard serial port (CONFIG_SERIAL) as a kernel module

  4. /etc/serial.conf (debian) includes the line
/dev/ttyS0 uart 16550 port 0x3F8 irq 3
   which shows up in dmesg

  5. add this line to /etc/modules.conf:
pre-install smc-ircc /usr/local/sbin/tosh5100-smcinit

  6. modprobe smc-ircc

  5. irattach /dev/ttyS0

  7. modprobe ircomm

  8. if using a pilot with pilot-link, pilot-xfer -p /dev/ircomm0 -l

</PRE>

I think that's it, although it's all buried in my start-up scripts now.
Under Debian the the irattach etc. config files are stored in 
<a href="irda.conf">/etc/irda.conf</a>, and I place an "<a href="irda">irda</a>"
file in /etc/init.d when I want the IR enabled at boot.
<P>

If this doesn't work for you, or you need some slightly different 
configuration (like different addresses, IRQs, or perhaps the 82801BAM), 
I suggest you get a digital camera (to see the IR beam, best
suggestion I've heard in ages!), the datasheets for the 82801 and the 
47N227, and have a play with these files:

<PRE>
<A href="./setpci.c"><strong>setpci.c</strong></A> PCI bridge set up
<A href="./setsmc.c"><strong>setsmc.c</strong></A> SMC chip set up
<A href="./dumpsmc.c"><strong>dumpsmc.c</strong></A> print SMC registers while r/w txmit/rcv (CPU burner! sufficiently fast that rcv picks up the glow even if no camera)
</PRE>

<P>
Again I haven't abeen able to confirm whether the FIR does anything.  Furthermore,
<a href="http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/docs.html">Jonathan Buzzard's Toshiba HCI docs</a>
describe a call to set the SIR vs. FIR status which the work presented here does not access.  
<p>
(update 21 Aug 02) According to results from hacking around on the 
<a href="http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver">Toshiba Extras</a> ACPI/HCI code, the SIR/FIR 
HCI call is not supported on this laptop.  
<p>
(update 30 Mar 03) After someone asked more questions about making this work
on another Toshiba laptop, I compiled the following selection of log files
and result messages:
<p>
on the first modprobe smc-ircc (from the command line) for me it claims to
fail:

<PRE>
vista:~# modprobe smc-ircc
/lib/modules/2.4.21-pre4/kernel/drivers/net/irda/smc-ircc.o: init_module: No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters,
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
/lib/modules/2.4.21-pre4/kernel/drivers/net/irda/smc-ircc.o: insmod
/lib/modules/2.4.21-pre4/kernel/drivers/net/irda/smc-ircc.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.21-pre4/kernel/drivers/net/irda/smc-ircc.o: insmod smc-ircc failed
</PRE>
<p>
dmesg and syslog have lots of
debug announcements (still) but the interesting lines seem to be:

<PRE>
found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227
ircc_open()
SMC IrDA Controller found
 IrCC version 2.0, firport 0x130, sirport 0x3f8 dma=3, irq=3

irport_open_Ra001cb4a(), can't get iobase of 0x3f8
...
irport_close_R13d1bc18(), Releasing Region 3f8
</PRE>
<p>
/var/log/messages should (might ?) also survive the crash:

<PRE>
Mar 29 23:02:26 vista kernel: found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227

Mar 29 23:02:26 vista kernel:  IrCC version 2.0, firport 0x130, sirport 0x3f8 dma=3, irq=3
</PRE>
<p>
on the second modprobe smc-ircc attempt, no complaints at the command
line.  dmesg/syslog say

<PRE>
found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227

irport_open_Ra001cb4a()

</PRE>
<p>
and now /var/log/messages has 2 more relevant lines:

<PRE>
Mar 29 23:08:09 vista kernel: found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227
Mar 29 23:08:09 vista kernel: SMC IrDA Controller found

Mar 29 23:08:09 vista kernel: IrDA: Registered device irda0
Mar 29 23:08:09 vista /etc/hotplug/net.agent: assuming irda0 is already up
</PRE>
<p>
Please note, as I discuss on the 
<a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100">5100</a> page, there is a 
conflict between using irda here and the non-kernel PCMCIA code, specifically the
ide_cs module which is needed for e.g. mounting compact flash cards.  Under
2.4.21-pre4/ACPI-patch I am able to rmmod/modprobe the various pcmcia and irda modules to go
back and forth using both systems.
<p>
I have now added 
<PRE>
pre-install ide-cs /etc/init.d/irda stop
post-remove ide-cs /etc/init.d/irda start
</PRE>
<p>
to my /etc/modules.conf file, this way the IrDA shuts down when I plug in my CompactFlash card (in a 
PCMCIA adaptor), then comes back when I pop the card out.  This didn't play well with SWSUSP because 
irattach doesn't always go away on a SIGTERM; in my <a href="irda">/etc/init.d/irda</a> script you will
see that I now 'kill -9' it if it doesn't die nicely.
<p>
<a NAME="smc-bugfix"></a><b><font size=+2>smc-ircc bug with SWSUSP</font></b> (suspend to swap partition)
<p>
The problem: once smc-ircc has been loaded (even if you later remove it), SWSUSP crashes at the end of the suspend 
when it says 'freeing memory'.  The line I think is missing is not in in kernels 2.4.20, 2.4.21pre4, or 2.5.67.  
<p>
<b>The fix:</b> In the Linux source tree, find drivers/net/irda/smc-ircc.c.
Go to the end of the file and find the routine ircc_close().  Add a line to make the beginning look like this:
<PRE>
#ifdef MODULE
static int __exit ircc_close(struct ircc_cb *self)
{
        int iobase;

        IRDA_DEBUG(0, "%s()\n", __FUNCTION__);
        ASSERT(self != NULL, return -1;);
        iobase = self->irport->io.fir_base;
        pm_unregister(self->pmdev);    // <<<<<---------- add this line
        irport_close(self->irport);

</PRE>

That's it; do 'make modules; make modules_install; rmmod smc-ircc; modprobe smc-ircc', and at least this 
part should not keep you from a sccessful suspend/resume.
<p>
One more thing, I'm now using smsc-ircc2 (see <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/IrDA/IrDA.html">Jean Tourrilhes' page</a>
and the <a href=http://www.csai.unipa.it/peri/smsc-ircc2/">erratic source site</a> for this code.  This (currently) has the same pm_unregister() bug 
as smc-ircc above.
<p>
I hope all of the above (smc-init and smc-ircc bugfix) works for you, or maybe helps, but 
there's absolutely no warranty -- if it doesn't work or 
otherwise causes your world to collapse, you may keep all the pieces.
